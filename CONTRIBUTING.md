# Contributing to the CodeWise Curriculum

There are many ways you can help out CodeWise. Our curriculum is essential to create an engaging and effective learning experience for our users.

## ✏️ Editing Curriculums

Our curriculums are a work-in-progress. Any new lesson ideas, reordering, or lesson removals you see fit are great to get started contributing!

Start by:
1. Finding your issue and search for the course's `curriculum.md` file.
2. Creating an issue for the requested change using the correct "Curriculum Change" template.
3. Filling out the issue describing the requested change.
4. Your issue will be reviewed. Once someone is assigned to it, they may create a PR for their change.

## ➕ Creating Lessons

You may also help us out by adding lessons from the curriculum that have not been added yet. Lessons must be created in order based on what is missing in the curriculum.

**You may only create lessons that are in the curriculum.** If you want to create a new lesson, you must follow the instructions for editing the curriculum first.

Start by:
1. Finding the course you want to create a lesson for and reviewing its `curriculum.md` file.
2. Choose the lesson to complete; the first unchecked lesson has the priority. If someone else has already created an issue regarding that lesson, you may start working on a future lesson. However, **your PR will only be approved once all previous lessons have been completed.**
3. _Thoroughly check_ that your lesson has not been created in an existing PR or already has an issue.
4. Create an issue using the correct "New Lesson" template. You will list the title, videos, exercises, and questions.
5. Once your project is assigned to someone (or yourself), you can create a PR for it.
6. **Make your lesson:** add the JSON file to the correct course directory with the information for your lesson. Remember to check your lesson's name in the `curriculum.md` by changing "- [ ]" to "- [x]"

## ✏️ Editing Lessons

Some of the lessons that are created will eventually need to be edited or improved. If you wish to add or remove a video, exercise, or question from a particular lesson, follow these steps:

1. Locate the desired lesson within the course's directory.
2. Describe the changes in an issue using the "Lesson Change" template.
3. Once your issue is approved, you may create a PR changing the JSON file for the lesson you wish to edit.

## Making your first PR

Great! You have followed the steps above and are ready to make a change to our curriculum. If you want to make the changes described in your issue, you should check the "do myself" checkbox in the issue's template. That will let us know that we should assign the issue to you. Otherwise, leave it unchecked and we will assign it to someone who volunteers.

Now, you need to make your changes and create a PR. You should use the given PR template information and give a detailed description of what your PR is for. You will also need to list the issues your PR solves. If you are making a PR for your own issue, simply add your issue's number.
