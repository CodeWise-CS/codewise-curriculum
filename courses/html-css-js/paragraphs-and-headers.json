Within the opening and closing tags, you can put the content of the paragraph. However, note that empty lines within your text will be ignored, so you must either use <br> to insert a new line or create another paragraph element.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Headers</h2>\n<p>If you want to insert titles, headings, or larger, more important text, you can use the HTML headers. There are 6 elements (h1-h6) that should be used based on the size and importance of the header. The h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest. New lines are also ignored in header elements.</p>"
