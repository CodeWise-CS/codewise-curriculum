## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codewise-curriculum.git
   cd codewise-curriculum
   ```
3. **Explore the files**
Navigate through the folders to find relevant materials:

1. `courses/`
2. `career-paths/`

3. **Contribute to CodeWise**
Create a new `.json` file in the appropriate directory and put all the necessary information.

The planned curriculum is listed in the courses' `curriculum.md` file. It organizes the topics that will be covered and their order (lessons that have not been created may be listed here). Once your lesson has been completed, check the lesson off the `curriculum.md` file and add a link to it's source. Follow this format:
```md
- [x] [capitalized_lesson_name](https://github.com/CodeWise-CS/codewise-curriculum/blob/main/courses/[course_name]/[lesson_file_name].json)
For example:
- [x] [Arithmetic Operations](https://github.com/CodeWise-CS/codewise-curriculum/blob/main/courses/python/arithmetic-operations.json)
```

Course lesson format (consisting of a lesson and exercise):
```js

        "startSeconds": /* seconds at which the video should start (-1 if N/A) */,
        "endSeconds": /* seconds at which the video should end (-1 if N/A) */
      },
      ... /* other video options. 1st video in array should be the "recommended" video */
    ],
    "exercises": [
      {
        "title": /* exercise title */,
        "content": /* description of the exercises with examples. E.g., "Write a program that greets a user named John Doe with the message \"Hello, John Doe!\"\n\nThen, try greeting yourself by changing the name." */,
         "solution": /* string containing the exercise's solution code. E.g., "print(\"Hello, John Doe!\")" *.

          "correct": false
        },
        {
          "answer": /* incorrect answer option */,
          "correct": false
        },
        {
          "answer": /* incorrect answer option */,
          "correct": false
      },
      /* ... any combination of question types */
    ]
  },
]
```

Career path format:
``` js
{
   /* course name (e.g., "frontend-engineer") */: {
    "title": /* course title (e.g., "Front-end Engineer") */,
    "courses": /* array of courses (e.g., "html-css", "javascript", "react", ...) */
  }
}
```

## **Testing Lessons**
It's important to test all lessons and changes to lessons before adding them to the curriculum. You can do this by forking the [website](https://github.com/CodeWise-CS/codewise-cs.github.io) repo and manually enter the lesson by replacing the highlighted code in [the LessonHandler.jsx](https://github.com/CodeWise-CS/codewise-cs.github.io/blob/2ed320913bf5452aeff76062d9fdbe48c53e5ac2/src/pages/Lesson/LessonHandler.jsx#L96) file with the object contianing your lesson (either the exercise or the lesson itself).

For example: `const lesson = {...}`
